                <h3>Project Title 1 :- Hand Gesture Recognition System </h3>
                <p>This project focuses on developing a smart health-monitoring device that continuously measures essential vital parameters using a BP monitor, SpO₂ sensor, and temperature sensor. The system is designed to assist patients, elderly individuals, and people with medical conditions by providing real-time tracking of blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. A key feature of the device is its gesture-based emergency alert mechanism, implemented using a strip (flex) sensor attached to the user’s hand. During an emergency, the user can perform a simple hand gesture, which is instantly detected by the flex sensor and used to trigger an automatic alert to caregivers or medical personnel. This hands-free alert capability ensures quick assistance even when the patient is unable to speak or reach a phone, making the device a reliable solution for remote healthcare, personal safety, and continuous medical monitoring. </p>

                <h3>Project Title 2 :- Energy genration using solar panel and horizontal wind terbine</h3>
                <p>This project aims to develop a hybrid renewable energy generation system using a solar panel and a horizontal-axis wind turbine to produce clean and sustainable power. The setup combines the advantages of both solar and wind energy, ensuring continuous electricity generation even when one source is unavailable—solar energy during the day and wind energy whenever airflow is present. The solar panel converts sunlight into electrical energy, while the horizontal wind turbine captures kinetic energy from the wind and converts it into power through a generator. By integrating both systems, the project increases overall efficiency, improves energy reliability, and reduces dependence on conventional power sources. This hybrid model is ideal for rural areas, small households, and off-grid applications, contributing to environmental sustainability and promoting the use of renewable energy technologies..</p>

                <h3>Project Title 3:- AI Disease Prdection for Pomogrande Fruit</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for early disease detection in pomegranate fruits to assist farmers in improving crop health and productivity. The system uses machine learning and image-processing techniques to analyze images of pomegranate leaves and fruits, identifying common diseases such as bacterial blight, fruit spots, and fungal infections. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a dataset of healthy and diseased samples, the system can automatically classify the disease type with high accuracy. The solution helps farmers take timely actions, reduce crop loss, and minimize the use of unnecessary pesticides. This AI-powered approach provides a fast, affordable, and reliable method for real-time disease monitoring in pomegranate farming, supporting sustainable agriculture and smarter farm management.</p>
